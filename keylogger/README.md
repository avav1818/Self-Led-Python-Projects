# Keylogger

### Introduction
* A keystrke logger, aka, spyware, is surveillance software that monitors and logs keys struck on your keyboard.
* Performs surveilance behind-the-scences so that the end user is unaware of their key strokes being monitored.
* Used with malicious intent to steal unauthroised data; passwords, banking credentials, identity theft and more.
* Also used for the surveillance of minors as seen in a guardian:child relationship or when employers want to track employee activity at work.
* Function when a user installs, usually without knowing, a malicious program masked to be of benefit to the user e.g. a game or production software.
* Certain sites can be infected and result in the installation of a keylogger


### Code implementation 
* The assumption is that the keylogger has been installed on a victim machine with poorly or non-existent antivirus software.
* The keylogger was tested in VirtualBox on a windows 7 machine  


### Versions
Python file: `keylogger0_0_1.py`
* A simple implementation that tracks keystrokes on a macOs, windows or linux machine that has a poorly configure antivirus software
